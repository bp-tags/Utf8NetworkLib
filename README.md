Utf8NetworkLib
==============

Small C# library for protocols consisting of delimited UTF-8 character streams.

Check TestApplication code for demo (does both client and server).

Remember to implement some kind of application level keep-alive/heartbeat.

This was extracted from MoonSharp debugger network facilities.. so it's not really general purpose but works in most scenarios. 

Documentation is in the code, and very little in the project wiki.
